<q><h3>Nebraska.Code()</h3>
<p>Nebraska.Code() was founded in 2011 in Lincoln Nebraska, by a software development community hungry for training and networking opportunities. Going strong into 2021 Nebraska.Code() attracted over 600 attendees from over 10 states across the country. With a track dedicated to Project Management the scope of our event has grown from just software development to content covering all aspects of the software development lifecycle.</p></q> - Amegala
